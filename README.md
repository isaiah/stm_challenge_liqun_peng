# Springer Nature Code Challenge

Below is a coding challenge that we would like you to solve. Please read through the description carefully and implement a solution for it. We don't want you to over-engineer the solution but be prepared to extend the functionality in the next step of the interview process. Finally, we ask you to submit a solution that you'd be happy to go live with and works "out of the box‚Äù.

Please complete the challenge in your preferred language.

Please create a new git branch and then commit to this as you work. When you have finished please create a pull request to master. We will then review it within 7 days. Please do not make your solution public. 

**Good Luck!**


## Things We Value

* Working software!
* Tests.
* A working build.
* Small checkins with good comments.
* A simple readme with build and run instructions, and maybe talk about trade offs and design decisions you made.
* Simple code (but not necessarily easy!)
* The fewer libraries the better - we want to see your code. If you do use a library then explain why in the readme.
* We like functional constructs but also value good domain names and modelling.
* Evidence you have thought about edge cases and errors (either in code or the readme).

## Enough talk, the Problem

You're given the task of writing a simple console version of a drawing program. The functionality of the program is quite limited but should be extensible. The program should work as follows:

1. create a new canvas.
2. start drawing on the canvas by issuing various commands.
3. quit.

The program should support the following commands:
   
| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `C w h`     | Should create a new canvas of width w and height h. |
| `L x1 y1 x2 y2` | Should create a new line from `(x1,y1)` to `(x2,y2)`. Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the `x` character. |
| `R x1 y1 x2 y2` | Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is `(x1,y1)` and lower right corner is `(x2,y2)`. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the `x` character. |
| `B x y c` | Should fill the entire area connected to `(x,y)` with colour `'c'`. The behaviour of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs. |
| `Q` | Should quit the program. |
 
## Sample I/O

Below is a sample of the output your program should produce. User input is prefixed with `enter command:`.


	enter command: C 20 4
